        <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
        <p>
            Outlast 2 is the sequel to the acclaimed survival horror game Outlast. 
            Set in the same universe as the first game, but with different characters and a different setting, Outlast 2 is a twisted new journey into the depths of the human mind and its dark secrets. <br>
            Outlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers, who left our wicked world behind to give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness and hidden from civilization. 
            Knoth and his flock are preparing for the tribulations of the end of times and you’re right in the thick of it. <br>
            You are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch. <br>
            You’re following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe. The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, 
            to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.
