        <h1>Horizon II: Forbidden West</h1>
        <video src="./horizon forbiden west/horizonfw.mkv" controls></video>
        <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
        <p>
            Horizon Forbidden West continues the story of Aloy half a year after the events of the Zero Dawn, 
            a young huntress of the Nora tribe sent on a quest to a mysterious frontier spanning Utah to the Pacific coast to find the source of a mysterious plague that kills all it infects. 
            On her journey across the uncharted lands of the Forbidden West, she encounters hostile regions filled with natural threats and ravaged by massive storms, dangerous enemies and deadly machines, both new and old. 
            As Aloy attempts to explore the wider and deeper parts of the Forbidden West, she discovers a vast array of diverse environmental ecosystems, including lush valleys, dry deserts, snowy mountains, tropical beaches and ruined cities, 
            both above and below the water. <br>
            "The land is dying. Vicious storms and an unstoppable blight ravage the scattered remnants of humanity, while fearsome new machines prowl their borders. 
            Life on Earth is hurtling towards another extinction, and no one knows why. It's up to Aloy to uncover the secrets behind these threats and restore order and balance to the world. Along the way, she must reunite with old friends, 
            forge alliances with warring new factions and unravel the legacy of the ancient past â€“ all the while trying to stay one step ahead of a seemingly undefeatable new enemy. 
            Uncover the secret behind Earth's imminent collapse and unlock a hidden chapter in the ancient past... one that will change Aloy forever."
