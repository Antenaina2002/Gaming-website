        <h1>God Of War: Ragnarök</h1>
        <video src="./god of war/god of war-trailer.mkv" controls></video>
        <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
        <p>
            Several years after the events of the previous game, Kratos and Atreus still live in their house in the middle of the woods in Midgard, together with Mímir. 
            Their daily life alternates between intensive training and hunting outside the protection zone that surrounds their house. During these excursions and at the request of Atreus, they have rescued wolves from marauders and use them as hounds to facilitate their travel. 
            These trips are not only threatened by the marauders, however: their former ally Freya, still mourning the death of her son Baldur at the hands of Kratos, is hunting them down in order to exact her revenge on the repentant god of war. <br>
            One night, Atreus' oldest recovered wolf, Fenrir, dies and the young boy unknowingly casts a mysterious spell in his grief. The pain of losing his companion even pushes him, after burying the wolf, to transform into a bear and he almost kills his father. 
            He later confesses his exasperation at not being able to search for the answers concerning himself after the discovery of the Jötunheim fresco that had anticipated their previous journey, which puts him in conflict with his father, who fears that the quest for his answers will trigger a war with the Aesir gods.
