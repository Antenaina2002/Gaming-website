        <h1>Ghost of Tsushima</h1>
        <video src="./ghost of tsushima/got-trailer.mkv" controls></video>
        <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
        <p>
            In 1274, the Mongol army led by Khotun Khan, fictional cousin of Kublai Khan , landed on the beaches of the Japanese island of Tsushima facing 80 samurai led by the daimyo , the Jitō Shimura ( Akio Ōtsuka ) and his nephew Jin Sakai ( Kazuya Nakai ) — collected and raised by the latter following the murder of his father and the death of his mother, sister of the Daimyo Shimura. 
            The samurai are easily swept away by the Mongols who have the advantage of numbers but also have the experience of the Khan ( Tsutomu Isobe) who studied the samurai's code of honor and tactics in order to turn them against them. 
            Jin Sakai is left for dead at the end of the carnage. <br>
            When he wakes up Jin finds that he has been saved by a thief named Yuna ( Yufu Mizuno ) who asks him in return to help her save her brother Taka, a prisoner of the Mongols. 
            Jin makes him the promise but first tries to deliver his uncle, held prisoner in Kaneda Castle, but fails easily beaten by Kothun Khan. <br>
            Deciding to recruit her for a new assault, Jin helps Yuna rescue Taka, who decides to forge weapons for his troops to thank him. He also recruits Ishikawa ( Shigeru Chiba ), the peninsula's greatest archer, but whose pupil has sided with the Mongols; Dame Masako ( Mabuki Andou ), last survivor of the Adachi clan, massacred by a rival clan who used the opportunity presented by the invasion to get rid of the clan; and finally, his childhood friend Ryuzo, leader of the rônin mercenaries called Straw Hats. 
            During his journey, Jin will gradually question his teaching and abandon bushido for less honorable, but more effective methods of combat.
